# MAX17048G+T10 Fuel Gauge Sensor
Analog Devices MAX17048G+T10 Lithium Ion 1S Fuel Gauge Librery


This is an Arduino library for interfacing the Analog Devices MAXIM-MAX17048G+T10 Lithium Ion 1S Fuel Gauge. These ICs communicate with an I2C bus at speeds up to 400kHz, and the MAX17048G library uses the Wire library and simple Wire funtions to operate, but due to some problems, I am creating this librery.


MAX17048G+T10 is the latest chip manufacturing by Analog Devices and very low cost compered to others chip in same catagory. Working of this chip is little bit different from the MAX17043/44 older chip.
